# Project Overview

Our project is a blog site. The site's programming is done with JavaScript, the interface is designed with React, and database operations are handled with Firebase. The project includes features such as UI design, Object-Oriented Programming, Object-Relational Mapping, Web Service connection, Role-Based Access, and User authentication. Users on the site are divided into three categories: authors, readers, and admins. Authors can add text content to the site and delete the content they have added. Admins have authority over all content. Readers can only read the published content.
